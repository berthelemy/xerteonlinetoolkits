The Xerte Project provides a suite of award-winning open-source tools for elearning developers and content authors producing interactive learning materials. The tools are in use in institutions and organisations all over the world, with an enthusiastic community of users, and an active team of developers working to bring new features and enhancements to the software.

The whole suite comprises four software applications:

* **Xerte Online Toolkit** is a server-based application for content authors. Elearning materials can be authored quickly and easily within the browser, with no programming required, and content can be delivered to all devices. This documentation is for this application.

* **Xerte 2.x** is a fully-featured e-learning development environment for creating rich interactivity. Xerte is aimed at developers of interactive content who will create sophisticated content with some scripting, and Xerte can be used to extend the capabilities of Xerte Online Toolkits with new tools for content authors.

* **Xerte Flex Compiler**  is a set of tools for developers working with the open-source Flex SDK to create advanced interactivity and applications for the Flash Player. Xerte Flex Compiler can create apps for iOS and Android.

* **Xpert** is a respository for sharing and re-using learning materials. Xerte Online Toolkits integrates with Xpert to make it simple to publish open content and have it surface in the Xpert repository for learners to use and other content developers to re-use, adapt and repurpose. Other content authors can easily contribute resources via RSS. 

With the release of v2.0 of Xerte Online Toolkits, content can be delivered to any device removing the dependency on the Flash Player. Also, a new responsive template enables authors to deliver content to all devices, from an iPhone to a large desktop computer, and the Xerte Online Toolkit now contains over 75 templates for presentation and interactivity.
