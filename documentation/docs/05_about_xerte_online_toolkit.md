# History

Work on Xerte began in May 2004. The project was inspired by two pieces of software: Authorware provided instructional designers with tools to rapidly create powerful interactivity, and Flex - at that time at version 1.0 and costing $20k per server - provided an xml vocabulary for describing rich interactive content. Initial work began on developing the .xml format, and a .swf based engine that could parse the xml and produce content dynamically in the Flash Player. At that time ActionScript was still at v1.0 and the Flash Player was v6.0.

As this work progressed, work began on an editor for the .xml format, and the .rlo file format was created, and enhancements to the Flash Player made loading and parsing large .xml files feasible. A very early version of Xerte appeared in January 2005, and was refined over the following 18 months until September 2006 when the first version was made freely available from the University of Nottingham. Feedback was very positive and the application tapped into a huge demand for easy to use tools for creating rich interactive content. Xerte had always been aimed at developers, and being able to write some script, and understanding the world of objects, properties, methods and events was a pre-requisite for using the tool successfully. Many users came to the tool without those insights and found it difficult to use. It was clear that there was a need for tools for non-scripting authors to use.

With a growing number of users providing feedback, and experiences on some major projects, the application matured and stabilized over the next couple of years, and the functionality increased. In particular, the functionality to support dynamic data-driven templates was developed, along with the idea of a generic wizard that could edit .xml data used to drive templates using a wizard interface configured by a type of style sheet. This put Xerte within reach of the non-scripting content authors, and created a very powerful workflow for developers.

During 2008, work began to put the wizard and templates into the browser. Xerte Online Toolkits provides a powerful suite of tools, and greatly simplifies the authoring process, particularly for those users who do not want to get involved in scripting, and adds to the authoring process support for collaboration, sharing, re-purposing and re-use of content. Xerte and a beta of Xerte Online Toolkits were released as open-source software in September 2008 with v1.0 of Xerte Online Toolkits following in April 2009.

Xerte 2.0 was released in January 2012 - with a fully accessible HTML5 output, as well as a responsive template based on Twitter Bootstrap.
